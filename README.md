This Power BI project analyzes survey data from 630 global data professionals to uncover trends in job roles, salaries, technologies, and workplace satisfaction. The dataset includes information on job titles (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst), preferred programming languages, geographic distribution of respondents, and self-reported ratings for salary and work-life balance.

The dashboard includes:

Bar charts to compare average salaries and favorite programming languages by job role

Map visuals and clustered columns showing the number of respondents by country

Donut charts representing perceived difficulty of the data field

Gauge KPIs displaying overall happiness with salary and work-life balance

Slicers and filters to enable dynamic data exploration
